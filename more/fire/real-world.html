                Models such as this forest fire model can be used in the real world in a number of ways including: to better understand a phenomenon, to explain it to others, to design solutions, and to make predictions. Models are always simplifications of reality, but they can still be very useful.
                Fire fighters use similar models to understand how to prevent and respond to forest fires. Some ways this model could be extended to be more realistic include:

            <div style="padding: 10px"></div>
            <ul>
                <li>adding a dryness factor that affects how likely trees are to burn</li>
                <li>adding wind to make the fire more likely to spread in one direction </li>
                <li>adding other features, like rivers, which can disrupt fire spread</li>
            </ul>
