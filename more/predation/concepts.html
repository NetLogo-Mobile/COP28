                This model showcases two very important complex systems concepts: dynamic stability and tipping points.  For many values of the grass regrowth rate, the ecosystem is dynamically stable: the populations fluctuate in cycles but all the species stay alive. However, there are tipping points for grass regrowth, both too slow and too fast, that lead to extinction:

            <div style="padding: 10px"></div>
            <ul>
                <li>When it is too slow, sheep donâ€™t have enough food and go extinct followed by the wolves.</li>
                <li>When it is too fast, the  sheep population booms due to the abundant grass. Then the wolf population booms and there are so many they eat all the sheep. With no sheep left, the wolves then also go extinct. </li>
                <li>For some grass regrowth values, wolves go extinct but sheep stay alive indefinitely.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>Many ecosystems are at risk due to climate change affecting the rates of survival of many plant and animal species.</span>
